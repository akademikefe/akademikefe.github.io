      <description>I was born into this round world around the end of the 80s, towards the conclusion of what we call the beautiful season, close to the end of September, on the 25th day, at noon. Although I&amp;rsquo;d like to make a literary entrance, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been good with literature. Turkish and literature classes were always tough for me. I even failed in university. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t my fault, but the teacher had it out for me :)</description>
